                Denmark will most probably fail to reach its ambitious goal of 70% reduction
                in CO2 emissions by 2050<sup>1</sup>.
                In this context, Denmark’s largest land user - min 34,1%<sup>2</sup>, significant GHG emitter - ca. 7,1%
                GHG.<sup>3</sup>,
                and largest contributor to reduced biodiversity<sup>3</sup>, the Danish Pig Industry represents one of
                the greatest
                barriers to Denmark’s Green Transition<sup>4</sup>. Despite a limited proportion to GDP<sup>3</sup>, and
                employment<sup>6</sup>, as an
                industry with a powerful political lobby and a strong cultural position, it has been largely successful
                to date in constructing the perception that change is politically and economically impossible.

                <br>



            <div id="columns">

                Three features distinguish the developed spatial-actor-network (SPA-ANT) approach to mapping
                environmental issues
                from existing ones.
                First, the plurivocality; each actor may tell her version of the
                story in different ways. This creates the opportunity for a more informed,
                collaborative, participatory, democratic process based on diverse sources of data-
                and knowledge. Second, highly important for environmental governance in the Anthropocene,
                it focuses upon the heterogeneity of nodes that extend beyond humans to include the non-human
                actors e.g. pigs, bees etc., acknowledging their agency and formative role in social action.
                Third, it connects actors and influences to space enabling targeted, spatial policy
                recommendation and action.

            <div id="columns">

            The policy goals and implementation of proposed change take the 
            form of quantified goals discussed in disciplinary silos – 
            focused on technological solutions, with little or no focus on the 
            societal, spatial and environmental implications. The culturally deep rooted
             Danish pig industry is a contested territory. It consists of actors’ conflicting
              values, opinions and interests. In this context, through the use of digital technologies, this project explores visualisation methods which could effectively make visible the points of collision, obligatory points of passage, pressure points; the spatial, logistical, economic, and societal enablers as well as obstacles to change within the resulting monospecies Danish landscape. This narrative network approach aims to supplement the standard spatial planning tools such as GIS with the power of network analysis and participation.

                    The complexity of the pig industry, its interrelated actors, and the opacity of
                    its corresponding spatial and environmental impacts makes an understanding of these
                    interdependencies difficult to a non-expert audience, planners, policymakers and politicians.
                    As, the use and transformation of territories are the result of collective material practices,
                    behavior and decisions embedded in space over time, (IPCC, 2019; Diaz, S. et al, 2019), it is
                    the project’s point of departure, that the challenges posed by climate change (UNEP, 2019) and the
                    deterioration of biodiversity (IPBES, 2019) cannot be met sufficiently, unless a combined
                    spatial–actor-network
                    (SPA-ANT) perspective is adopted. Complex patterns of actor-network relationships create mutual
                    action-outcome dependencies,
                    which produce space. For example, changes in policy regarding pig feed in one region, contribute to
                    land use change or
                    deforestation in another (Zu Ermgassen, 2015). Knowledge of the complex relations between both human
                    and non-human actors co-producing the contested territories through collective narratives
                    is essential to understand the spatial, logistical, economic, and societal barriers as well as
                    enablers of change in the context of the crisis and has long been recognized within the
                    interdisciplinary scholarship (Berkes et al, 2003; DeFries, 2017).

                    The disciplinary boundaries often define the relationships considered; hence, either
                    ecological or non-human perspectives tend to be oversimplified or disregarded (Pelosi, 2010).
                    Additionally, the dominance of abstract, quantitative approaches to this crisis resulting in
                    a limited palette of data visualization formats as well as the use of spatial and actor-network
                    representations, to interpret existing conditions, neglect the importance and dynamism of the social
                    landscape, obstruct the debate, co-thinking, and participatory environmental governance (Hajer,
                    2012),
                    in which actor relations, influences and scenarios are collectively addressed and evaluated in
                    spatial
                    and territorial terms (e.g. Kunze et al., 2012). To navigate within the complexity, the future
                    citizens,
                    decision-makers and planners need to be equipped with tools to explore and visualize the
                    interrelation between
                    the spatial dynamics of the crisis and the plurivocality of public debate, contested values,
                    non-human perspectives–
                    in other words the narratives inherent in environmental issues. Here , the project aims to address
                    the following questions:

                    <em>
                        1) When a singular, highly centralized and specialized industry such as the pig industry shapes
                        the
                        spatial, cultural, political, and biological landscape of a large part of the Danish territory,
                        how can

                        perspectives, and of human and non-human interests? How can this eventually become a base for
                        effective environmental governance and planning?

                    Three features distinguish the SPA-ANT from existing approaches.
                    First, the plurivocality; each actor may tell her version of the story
                    in different ways. This creates the opportunity for a more informed, collaborative,
                    participatory, democratic process based on diverse sources of data- and knowledge.
                    Second, highly important for environmental governance in the Anthropocene,
                    drawing upon Actor-Network Theory (ANT) (Latour, 1999; 2005; Callon, 1989), it focuses
                    upon the heterogeneity of nodes that extend beyond humans to include the non-human actors
                    e.g. pigs, bees etc., acknowledging their agency and formative role in social action (e.g.
                    what a pig eats conveys to alternative farmers a story about soil fertility etc.). Third, it
                    connects actors and influences to space enabling targeted, spatial policy recommendation and action.

                    The following diagram presents the conceptual framing of the project:

                    Therefore, based on ANT, Controversy Mapping (CM) and post-representational Cartographic Theory,
                    this project aims to discuss appropriate theory and approaches to visualizing complex actor-network
                    relations of the DK’s pig industry and their spatial impacts. Furthermore the project, through the
                    creative use of digital technologies, aimed to develop a participatory online tool for making
                    interrelations between actors co-producing associated territories visible through collective mapping
                    of the current conditions and associated actor narratives. The SPA-ANT approach and the interface
                    are aimed to be tested with stakeholder groups relevant to each case study and attempts to reveal
                    barriers as well as enablers for the sustainable transition within the industry, through social
                    network and cartographic analysis methods. It attempts to analyze and visualize three controversies
                    forming a base for future collaborative scenario making:

                    Deep research into cartographic theory helped to formulate initial
                    theoretical and methodological foundation for this project, develop visual language,
                    and code for the interface. A. Yaneva and T. Venturini (2010) - state-of-the-art scholars
                    in the field of controversy mapping (CM) were consulted in regards to the development of
                    the SPA-ANT approach and the interface. Yaneva’s (2012) application of the CM method to
                    architecture, by the usage of digital tools to navigate the socio-technical debates around
                    spatial objects revealed a great potential to treat them as dynamic, ’possessing an immense
                    capacity of connecting heterogeneous actors’.<br>
                    Furthermore, the broad range of applications of ANT in the planning field
                    addresses not only analytical views on theory (Boelens, 2007), but also
                    planning methodologies, and policy recommendations (Healey, 2007).
                    Building upon its historical role (CIAM 1933, Abercrombie 1944),
                    mapping is a key methodology in the contemporary spatial planning
                    and design disciplines (Paez, 2019) challenging established
                    understanding of the world through showing, rather than
                    telling about less-visible dynamics (i.a. technological,
                    social, economic, political, ecological) manifested in
                    space (Weizman 2017, Kurgan et al. 2019). The more recent
                    renewal of mapping traditions (e.g. van Susteren 2005;
                    Simpson et al. 2018), invigorated by new technologies (e.g. GIS, ‘big data’) as ‘a means to
                    make the
                    complex accessible’ (Abrahams et al. 2006) engages a shift from ‘representational’ and
                    ‘critical’
                    mapping towards the ‘post-representational’ (Della Dora, 2009, Kitchin, 2010), which puts
                    its focus
                    on the interactions and co-authorships between actors producing it, context and audience.
                    <br>

                    Both approaches, open possibilities for new ways of mapping and seeing territories
                    in the Anthropocene, their governance, societal and educational change. However,
                    both spatial representations (SPA-) and actor-network graphs (-ANT), are rarely
                    juxtaposed as mutually enriching visualization forms revealing actor-network/territorial
                    relationships.
                    The complex actor-network graphs allow often for a ‘thick’ reading (Geertz, 1973) of the
                    systems’
                    capacity to change, are often however predominantly abstract, non-spatial, challenging for
                    the
                    non-expert audience, and limited in narrative making capabilities. On the other hand, more
                    accessible, spatial representations offer a wider range of formats to analyze and
                    communicate, are
                    usually
                    limited in revealing actor relations.

                    Projects revealing their usability in boosting understanding of climate change issues, their
                    mitigation options (i.a Schroth et al., 2009), and better decision making (Wong and Chua,
                    2001)

                    less
                    abundant on the use of visual tools within mapping of the spatial–actor (SPA-ANT) relations

                    actual environmental impact assessment (Oliveira, 2020). Literature review and further
                    expert
                    interviews will help to formulate relevant theoretical background for the project. The
                    developed
                    digital tool (O2) (i.a. Three.js framework for online 3d-interfaces) aims to merge the
                    advantages of Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) with Network Analysis Tools (e.g. Gephi). It
                    aims
                    to provide a web interface for spatial/actor-network analysis with public input (Sieber,
                    2006)
                    allowing for participation by formation of actor-network/spatial narratives by 2d/3d
                    representations of actors, maps, data visualizations, descriptions etc., and exploration of
                    the
                    data over the web (Evans et al. 1999).
                    In the next phases of the project, snowball sampling, in-depth semi-structured interviews
                    with a
                    handful of starting actors (acknowledged through previous research, press, formal positions,
                    Twitter scraping) representative to each controversy (C1, C2, C3) will be interviewed and
                    invited to use the tool to present their own perspectives, e.g. a pig fattening farmer from
                    Ringkøbing-Skjern will form a narrative around C1. pig-feed-biodiversity forming her links
