     <b><em>The right to invisible.</b></em>
     <br>
     <br>
    
     Current technological advancements have a real, physical impact on how people navigate, feel and socialize within the urban environment. The technological advancements, which make it to the urban mainstream become ubiquitous creating one continous layer of online connectivity, data gathering and surveillance. We took it for granted that the ‘hot spot’ needs to be uninterrupted and omnipresent. The singals or the “eyes of the city” were never treated in the same way as the physical - ready to be shaped or regulated as e.g. urban density.

     The project tries to question the ubiquity of this non-tangible digital city layer by proposing a BLIND SPOT - a place or a set of urban spaces - stripped of access to the global network and invisible for the “Eyes of The City”. It treats this impalpable layer as an environmental condition, fullfilling the architecture’s main basic task to provide shelter and separation from the forces of the ‘new nature’. 
     
     No other architectural form as well as the reasoning behind it represents the world of radiation and interconnectedness better than Buckminster Fuller’s geodesic dome. Through physical means we aim to create a ‘black whole’ within the exhibition space and raise questions on the omnipresence of the all-optimizing digital layer. 
     
     The Blind Spot either, ironically, becomes a museum-like display case of a pre-digital era, hosting inside a non-connected, non-surveilled space or allows to reflect and understand one’s place in the contemporary and the future city.

<p>

    - Should we regulate the omnipresence of urban technologies in the same way as we regulate physical density in our cities? <br>

    - Can we create the same variety within the invisible algorithmic layer as in the physical domain of our cities and how these two: so the material and immaterial environment can create more nuanced and human-centric interface?   <br>
    
    - As the digital layer becomes an integral part of the hybrid city, should we rewrite our building code to respond to this change? <br>
     
    - If so, should we, as humans, write ‘analogue’ laws or dynamic, algorithmic ‘law-as-code’ changing the way in which lawmakers formulate rules? <br>
    
    - If cities became “Formula One cars”, should we have a possibility to go out of the vehicle? <br>
    
    - Should we allow for technological blind spots within our cities to call them truly smart? <br>
    
    - As the computational dimension and the “Eyes of the City” becomes a blind spot for us as citizens- (a dimension impossible to see and hard to grasp) should we enforce “Blind Spots of the City” and reintroduce, “Eyes on the street”?

    <b><em>Necessarily ubiquitous?</b></em>
    <br>
    <br>
    
       The new hybrid between the  ubiquitous technologies and the physical domain challenges the idea that cities are homes to people, who develop relationships and communities in which their everyday lives unfold. Current technological advancements starting from smart phones and ever-present internet, through urban sensors measuring CO2 levels or traffic, up to, machine learning, AI and facial recognition cameras, challenge these concepts by adding an invisible, impalpable dimension to our urban environment. 
       
       As physical features are obviously place specific, it is often the case that every technological advancement which makes it to the urban mainstream becomes ubiquitous creating one continous layer of online connectivity, data gathering and surveillance. We took it for granted that the ‘hot spot’ needs to be uninterrupted and omnipresent. 
       
       Can we redesign this layer and think about it in more physical terms? Can we make it absent from particular designated parts of the city? Can this layer be more place specific rather than flat and pervasive?
       
    
    <br>

   

    <br>

    <b><em> Physical vs virtual </b></em>
   

    The physical, tangible and visible qualities of spaces between buildings were always central to the dynamics of city life: the perceptions that people have about them, signs, smells, openness, width, height, accessibility, attractiveness, greenery etc. were directly related to how people used them, but also what was their political message and agenda. This is not to say that the digital revolution killed urban spaces but rather shifted, and will continue to shift our relationship with them.
    
    From obvious changes of behaviour, such as in the context of limited internet access in Havana, where the citizens gather in designated public spaces to only shortly log in to the global network, through parks in Tokyo, where people meet during lunch break to go to look for pokemons, up to, facial recognition cameras surveilling streets of Shenzen, ensuring top-down controlled safety (but also preventing potentially many spontaneuos and seemingly chaotic interractions to happen).
    
    These contrasting scenarios within the ubiquity of access as well as the ubiquity of top-down surveillance and their impact on how people change their interraction within the public space is the main point of departure for the project.

    <b><em> Binary code vs superposition </b></em>
   <br> 
   <br> 

<p>Recent developments in post-representational cartography suggest, that the way we visualize cities is a process brought into being through embodied social and technical practices. It is a process of constant reterritorialization and reinscription through visualisation. Mapping available thanks to sensors, geospatial tracking and IOT, generates urban dashboards and real-time models of urban centres, through which new questions are raised about, who and what is included and excluded from the new “image of the city”. 

The proposed pavilion aims to be a space for this debate and by its physicality suggests a more conscious interplay between the physical and the digital layers of the city.
