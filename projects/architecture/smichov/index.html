     <br>
     <br>
    
     The new Smichov School project constitutes a great oppurtunity for establishing the new standard for the 21st century generation of educational facilities in Prague. 

The design proposes a very rational structure  and makes major portions of the school building accessible to the the Smichov district community. It aims to find a balance between programmed and unprogrammed outdoor and indoor space for groupwork and free creative use. Through clear recognizable programatic clusters and its arrangement, together with comunity-based participation at its center, it effectively establishes a one symbolic heart and a recognisable symbol of the Prague 5 new district.

<p>
    The new Smichov School aims to become not only an innovative facility, open to new methods of teaching but aims to unite students and communities through openness, easily accessible shared facilities, lifelong education concept, local events and partnerships abolishing the duality of education and ordinary life. 

The conceptual diagram depicts gradation of space where of space where other portions of the building are the the exclusive realms of the learners. It is circular, which depicts the possibility of multiple entrances from various directions providing the possibility of functioning throughout the day and night.

    <b><em>Inside Out</b></em>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>    
    
        Both the future urban context and the main pedestrian axis with the 2 adjacent parks and the railway tunnel led us to propose a simple, compact and sustainable atrium building.
        
        At the groundfloor level the central circulation space connects all facilities commonly used by children of Level 1 and 2. On upper floors, a circulation split allows to organise the school into two parts, differentiating the area of the younger children from the one of the older ones. 
        
        Each programatic cluster is organised around an adjacent green relaxation zone. These spaces together with more intimate niches distributed around the building become either additional places of study with different degrees of openess, groupwork or non-defined third spaces for creative use.
        </p>

            <b><em> Outside In</b></em>
           <br>
           <br>
        
        The level difference between the green pedestrian zone and south-east edge of the site with planned vehicle traffic connections was turned into an oppurtunity to create 2 main entrances and other multiple openings for the afternoon community use. This allowed not only to activate fully all 4 facades of the building but also for easy access and flexibility of use throughout the whole day. By activating all of the facades, then easy access is also possible to the part of the school yard that is in the sunlight, in the morning and in the afternoon.

    <p><b><em> The school of the future
        </b></em>
                <br>
                <br>
         By combining state of the art evidence based design solutions focusing on the human comfort, health and wellbeing, the new school boosts social interactions and physical activity, thereby enhancing a playful and dynamic learning environment. 
        
        The goal of the project is to create a public school building, where low tech sustainable solutions create awareness and improve the quality of the everyday life for the pupil, the staff and for the entire Smíchow City. A publicly oriented icon for Prague balances the social, environmental and economic aspects of sustainability. 
        
        The proposed school is the first in the new generation and should serve as a prime example for how to invest public money in sustainable solutions that last for decades.

    <p><b><em> Energy
    </b></em>
    <br>
    <br>


    Energy and indoor climate are closely tied together. When looking at an investmens in social capital, we should never compromise when it comes to educating our future generations. Experience shows however, that many new school projects globaly have put too much  focus on energy, creating schools with overheating problems and bad air quality.
    
    In this project, the ventilation rooms are placed close to where the most airflow is needed. Sports area has its own ventilation system in the basement and the floors above have decentralized systems.
    
    It is intended in later phases to analyse if it is beneficial to create decentralized systems in each classroom for even easier maintenance and low SFP ratings. This might however change the plans slightly. It is intended that parts of the windows in the classrooms can be opened to allow for natural stack ventilation into the atrium. The main atrium skylights can be adjusted in height to facilitate this.
    
    The sports facilities are placed underground which makes it is easy to maintain a good indoor climate.

        <p><b><em> Structural System
        </b></em>
        <br>
        <br>
        

        An easily readable concrete construction ensures low cost and stabilizes indoor climate with thermal mass. The column system that provides flexibility for a future reorganisation of the program, so important in ever changing educational system and its spaces. By usage of short span prefab hole decks, the structural build-up will be kept to a minimum and allow space for ducts and a large floor to ceiling height. The ceilings are designed as fleets of acoustic panels so that the concrete structure remains exposed.
        

        <p><b><em> Soil Balance
        </b></em>
        
        <br>
        
        
       <p> Due to future planned level difference, and ground works half of the school footprint reaches level +197 m and the other half stays on +200 m. This move aims to even out the soil balance, so important in terms of overall cost of construction and sustainability. This can be investigated in later phases and used precisely to design building and landscape. By placing the running track on the roof, this allows for more flexibility on site in terms of landscaping and usage of soil ( there is no need to flatten out the whole terrain on site).
    </p>
        <p><b><em> Daylight and Biophilic Design
        </b></em>
        
        <br>

        <p>
        To achieve all the benefits of daylight and good view out to the greenery, all offices and classrooms are places in the facade with a maximum depth of 8 meters. As the facades of classrooms we decided to use punched openings instead of full glazing. This allows us to use glass types with low amount of sun coatings and thereby maintaining the real color in the daylight.

         <p><b><em> Microclimate

        </b></em>
       
        <br>

         <p>
         Most of children do not differenciate between the interior and the exterior of a building. To most, the landscape is imply there to be explored in its own terms, as and when it is available to them. The question would be: How can we create a microclimatic, metaphorical landscape for physical exploration bearing in mind importance of fantasy and imagination at all age levels?
         
         Prague is mainly dominated by western winds. Combining this fact with a sun diagram allows us to design the building and outdoor spaces around it in accordance with microclimatic conditions and shifting scenarious throught the whole day usage. 
         We can create three different areas around the school for each time of the day. Morning sun hits the drop off area and the school yard to the east. In the afternoon the pedestrian axis together with after school activity center and multi-use hall creates a warm environment for the community. In the meanwhile the school volume creates shelter from wind on the west and east side of the building .
         
         The roof landscape provides both the children and the community a sunny, wind sheltered plaza independent from the densifcation process of the area.
